## Last Week's Accomplishments

> In this section, you can write about what you accomplished in the previous week.
	Helped work on actual implementation of the GUI that we plan on using for the rest of 
    the application. This includes the information that'll go in each specific panel and how
    we plan on reading that information in. Also talked about practical applications for when
    and how we want to test the fast-forwarding system.   
	
> Examples:
> Bug fixes, Features added, Links to Issues, Links to Pull-Requests, Lightning Talks, Bonus Sessions

## This Week's Plan

> In this section, you can write about what you have planned for next week.
    We have to work on our presentation mainly. I'm choosing to talk about how we're planning 
    to test the program with the kids I've worked with in the STEP program at RPI. Seeing as 
    a lot of this is tied into how younger audiences might be able to learn on their own outside
    of guided instruction, having the kids that a club that I'm apart of called coding&&community 
    work with the program will let us be able to further optimize how we set up the GUI specifically. 
    The goal is for everything to be relatively intuitive for the students, so that they can progress
    without being restricted to having someone hold their hand throughout the learning process.

## Anything Blocking?

> In this section, you can write about any blockers that you are having trouble in the project.

> Examples: Confusion on how to approach a problem, Limited experience with a specific technology
    We can't fully test everything until we implement the curriculum into the GUI, which is the goal of next 
    semester. Once we do that, the testing phase should run pretty smoothly.
